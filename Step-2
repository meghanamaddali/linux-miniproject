Second Step

1. Login as user1 and perform below
--commands:
su user1

When i was trying to create add a user through user1 it was saying i was'nt added in sudoers so do this:
sudo su from ec2user

sudo visudo

Under this add the user line:
## Allows people in group wheel to run all commands
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
user1   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL


2. Create users and set passwords – user4, user5
--commands:
sudo useradd user4
sudo passwd iamstrong97

sudo useradd user5
sudo passwd iamstrong97

3. Create Groups – app, database
--commands: 
sudo groupadd app
