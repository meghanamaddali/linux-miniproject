Sixth Step:

1. Login as ‘root’ user and perform below
sudo su 

2. Search for the file name ‘f3’ in the server and list all absolute  paths where f3 file is found.
find / -type f -name f3 2>/dev/null
/dir2/dir1/dir2/f3
/dir7/dir10/f3

find /: Start the search from the root directory /.
-type f: Search for files.
-name "f3": Match the file name exactly as "f3".
2>/dev/null: Redirect error messages (such as permission denied) to /dev/null to suppress them.

3. Show the count of the number of files in the directory ‘/’
ls -l / | grep "^-" | wc -l

ls -l /: Lists files in long format in the root directory /.
grep "^-": Filters only regular files (not directories or other types of files). In the long format listing, regular files start with -.
wc -l: Counts the number of lines.

4. Print last line of the file ‘/etc/passwd’
tail -n 1 /etc/passwd

tail : prints the last part of a file 
-n 1 : output of last line
